## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository is my personal workspace where I document my cybersecurity and networking learning as it happens — through written blogs and short video walkthroughs.

Instead of only writing notes, I focus on learning how different parts of a system work together, where common security concerns appear, and how basic monitoring and troubleshooting are done in real settings.

Each entry combines clear explanations with practical examples, using written blogs and short video walkthroughs to show how these concepts are used in day-to-day security and IT work.    
## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Build a strong foundation in networking and security architecture
