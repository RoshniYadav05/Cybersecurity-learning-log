## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository is my personal workspace where I document my cybersecurity and networking learning as it happens — through written logs and short video walkthroughs.

Rather than simply saving notes, I focus on thinking like a security analyst — understanding how systems operate, where risks emerge, and how defenders observe, detect, and respond to activity in real-world environments.

Each entry reflects my effort to bridge technical theory with practical security thinking, using both documentation and video explanations to mirror how professional security teams record investigations, system behavior, and lessons learned in operational settings.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Build a strong foundation in networking and security architecture

Understand how attacks and defenses map across system and network layers

Practice clear technical documentation and security reporting

Create a public portfolio that shows consistent, real-world cybersecurity learning and growth

## 🤝 Why I’m Sharing This Publicly

I believe learning is stronger when it’s documented and shared.
This repository helps me stay accountable, track my progress, and connect with others who are also building skills in cybersecurity and technology.

## 🎥 Video Learning Log
This repository includes short video walkthroughs where I explain each topic from Networking, Cybersecurity, tools and labs.
